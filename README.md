### What I learned

One of the most important lesson I learned during the project was perseverance. I had a lot of bugs during the project but I was able to find and fix them by being calm and focused.

### Continued development

I plan on doing one more project from the FrontendMentor challenges involving ajax/json to get myself acquainted with api integrations before starting on React.
